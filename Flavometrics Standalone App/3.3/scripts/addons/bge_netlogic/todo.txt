0.3.1

Some old 2.79 fixes, initial port to 2.8
added Nodes (MouseLook, GetChildByName, etc)

0.3.0

More math

0.2.9

KeyLogger (add a character logger node (when user types something, log it as a character))
String operations
0.2.8
Add Vec4 parameter
Removed status waiting from Vec cell
Added distance_ref, distance_max to start/update sound
Fixed cast error in update sound node ui
Removed status check for start/update sound
Add Start Game
Add Restart Game
Fixed value changed condition (missing reset line cause the condition to keep the triggered status)
0.2.7
Repeater node, added indexed outputs to predict evaluation order. It also makes clearer that there can be multiple outputs.
Repeater node now has a condition input.
0.2.6
The auto-update-trees on open file doesn't work because the invoked operator only updates the current tree. Fixes requires a procedure that doesn't depend
on the context (to avoid writing two functions that do the same stuff).
add Repeater node: executes the linked node once for each element of an input set / number
add Colliding Objects / OPN list output to collision node.
0.2.5
add custom node templates
changed ActionFindGameObject to fix a status waiting issue, implemented parent and branch root
0.2.4
add condition None
add world to screen
add screen to world
0.2.3
add a set scene node
0.2.2
add constant value node
fixed value changed node (previous value is now updated during reset)
add align axis to vect node
0.2.1
FIXED - crash on open blend file via double click (check context.window is not None)
add replace mesh node
0.2.0
ConditionCollision used to stay True after the first collision was detected. Changed to reset its status every logic frame.
Now the condition should become False as soon as the collision exits.
0.1.9
fix category name (Cinematic nodes to Cinematic Nodes)
0.1.8
Add bitmap font like function
Fix for PermissionError when the file has not been saved
Renamed "apply value to game object" to "apply motion/rotation/force/torque"
Moved "apply value to game object" not to "Basic Cinematic Nodes" category
Renamed "The Powa!" to "Force Code Update"
Renamed "Refresh Custom Nodes" to "Refresh Imported Nodes"
0.1.7

set action frame now plays a frame of an action (instead of setting the current frame of a playing action)
test set action frame
test stop action
install subnetwork: if the network is already installed, start it if the installer is set to start
in UpdateSound volume and attenuation should be optionally NULL, to not to change the current value

added serial sorting to network
fixed max step bug in logic network cycle
add random generator
0.1.1
add default to python parameters for debugging
